### Bacteria to Beef

Roza a biological researcher in a prominent microbiology lab, has been assigned the role of discovering and documenting bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize protein and specifically those that taste like beef.  Roza's lab has partnered with Improbable Beef to conduct this study.  Roza hypothesizes a good bacterial candidate may be found on the human body inside the human belly button.

For this study, Roza had developed a database of samples from volunteers.  For presentation Roza has developed a data dashboard depicting each volunteers's bacterial findings   
in the following charts:

* Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found
* Bacteria Cultures per Sample
* Belly Button Washing Frequency

The dashboard is interactive and shows data by volunteer:
